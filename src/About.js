        Why hello there! I see you've stumbled onto my page out of the billions
        the world wide web has to offer. Having retired from the sport of track
        cycling as an Olympian, I took the skills I honed for more than a decade
        of competition into academics. Graduating with a B.S. in Computer
        Science was a great foundation, but I wanted more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering into Digital Crafts' immersive full-stack development program
        has elevated my technical skills immensely and you can see some of the
        larger projects I've been a part of. Thanks for the interest and don't
        hesitate to get in-touch if I can be of assistance!
      </p>
