        Why hello there! With the billions of pages the world wide web has to
        offer I am happy you chose to visit mine. As an Olympian in the exciting
        sport of track cycling, I have transferred the skills I honed from more
        than a decade of competition into the realm of academics. Graduating
        with a B.S. in Computer Science was a great career foundation, but I
        wanted more.

        Enrolling into Digital Crafts' immersive full-stack development program
        has elevated my technical skills immensely giving me some of the “more”
        I am seeking. Included in this site is a sampling of the larger projects
        I have developed or contributed to. Thanks for the interest and don't
        hesitate to get in-touch if I can be of assistance!
      </p>
